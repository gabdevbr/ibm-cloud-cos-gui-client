# IBM Cloud Object Storage Client - SOLID Refactoring

## Refactoring Overview

This project has been refactored to follow SOLID principles without overengineering. The original monolithic class has been split into focused, testable components.

## SOLID Principles Applied

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **AuthenticationService**: Handles only authentication and client creation
- **CloudStorageService**: Manages file operations (upload, download, delete, list)  
- **IBMCloudCOSClient**: Focuses solely on UI presentation logic
- **Data Models**: Each model has a single purpose (Credentials, ConnectionConfig, FileItem)

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Services are defined through interfaces, making them open for extension
- New storage providers can be added by implementing `CloudStorageService`
- New authentication methods can be added by implementing `AuthenticationService`

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- All implementations properly substitute their interfaces
- Interface contracts are well-defined and respected

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Small, focused interfaces instead of one large interface
- `AuthenticationService` and `CloudStorageService` have specific responsibilities
- No client depends on methods it doesn't use

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level UI depends on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations
- Services are injected through constructor injection
- Easy to mock and test individual components

## Architecture

```
IBMCloudCOSClient (UI Layer)
    ↓ depends on
AuthenticationService & CloudStorageService (Interfaces)
    ↓ implemented by
IBMAuthenticationService & IBMCloudStorageService (Implementations)
    ↓ uses
Data Models (Credentials, ConnectionConfig, FileItem)
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Testability**: Each component can be unit tested independently
2. **Maintainability**: Changes to business logic don't affect UI and vice versa
3. **Extensibility**: New storage providers or authentication methods can be added easily
4. **Readability**: Code is organized logically with clear responsibilities
5. **Reusability**: Services can be reused in different contexts (CLI tools, web apps, etc.)

```

## Usage

The refactored client maintains the same external interface but now benefits from better internal organization:

```java
// Dependency injection is supported
AuthenticationService authService = new IBMAuthenticationService();
IBMCloudCOSClient client = new IBMCloudCOSClient(authService);

// Or use default constructor
IBMCloudCOSClient client = new IBMCloudCOSClient();
```

## Testing

Each service can now be tested independently:

```java
// Test authentication without UI
AuthenticationService authService = new IBMAuthenticationService();
Credentials creds = new Credentials("access", "secret");
ConnectionConfig config = new ConnectionConfig("endpoint", "region");
AmazonS3 client = authService.authenticate(creds, config);

// Test storage operations with mock client
CloudStorageService storageService = new IBMCloudStorageService(mockClient);
List<String> buckets = storageService.listBuckets();
```
